    "### Question 1:\n",
    "Please explain the following terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Cryptography: Cryptography is an ancient art dating as far back as 500 BC, but with the development of computer science it is considered a legitimate science. It is defined as the science of creating secure methods of communication. In modern applications, cryptography supports privacy integrity, authentication and anonymity. We see this in e-commerce, e-government and other e-applications. A key component of cryptography is transforming plaintext into ciphertext through encryption, and then back again to plaintext in a process called decryption. This ensures the confidentiality between all parties securely communicating.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Encryption: Encryption can be defined when data is modified with a special encoding process so that the data becomes unrecognizable. This is different from obfuscation alone as the key part of encryption is to keep the data secret from others, so that the data cannot be interpreted by anyone except for the intended receipient(s). Encryption transforms data so that only specific individuals can reverse the transformation. There are different types of encryption, the main two being Symmetric Key Encryption and Asymmetric Key Encryption.  The difference of the two being symmetric key encryption uses the same key for encryption/decryption and in asymmetric encryption it uses a different key.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Plain Text: Plaintext text can be defined as unencrypted data that can be read and understood without any special measures. Normally in the case of cryptography, this is usually the target for many attackers.\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Cipher Text: Ciphertext is encrypted text transformed from plaintext using some encryption algorithm as a means of keeping data confidential when in transit or at rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "E. Decryption: The conversion of encrypted data back to its original form (normally plaintext) is a process known as decryption. Normally in end to end encryption the private key will be the one to decrypt the data. Decryption can be done manually or automatically and is normally done with a set of keys or passwords. \n",
    "\n",
    "F. Double Strength Encryption: Double strength encryption is the process of encrypting an already encrypted data more than once. This area of encryption is often up for debate as sometimes it adds extra layers of complexity, and can lead to meet in the middle attacks. An example of this is 2DES which is so insecure, that it should not be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "G. Hybrid Encryption: Hybrid encryption is a unique approach to combining symmetric and asymmetric key encryption. This process usually starts off with a random session key generated by one party and a public key contained in a provided digital certificate.  The encrypted RSA symmetric session key is then transmitted and the recipient can then decrypt the session key with their private key. If the verification is eligible for decryption with the session initiator then the symmetric key exchange is successful.   \n",

    "### Question 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. What is hash function in Cryptography?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In cryptography, hash functions transform input data of arbitrary size to a result of fixed size, which is called hash value. Secure hash functions are collision resistant and infeasible to invert:\n",
    "- Collision resistance implies that finding 2 inputs that result in the same hash value is extremely unlikely, such that hashes are considered to almost uniquely identify their corresponding input.\n",
    "- Infeasibility to invert means it is extremely hard (practically impossible) to find an input that hashes to a given hash value by brute force.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most modern strong cryptographic hash functions there are no known collisions.\n",
